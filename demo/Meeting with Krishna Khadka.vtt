00:00:04.478 --> 00:00:04.788
And.

d3f2ed12-e307-4a47-acde-68dc1550e251/4270-0
00:00:06.258 --> 00:00:09.129
Hello everyone. I'm Krishna
Karta and today I'll be

d3f2ed12-e307-4a47-acde-68dc1550e251/4270-1
00:00:09.129 --> 00:00:12.386
presenting the idea password
pattern identification and in

d3f2ed12-e307-4a47-acde-68dc1550e251/4270-2
00:00:12.386 --> 00:00:15.754
this Hack Fest project I have
worked with Yashpreet Kaur. So

d3f2ed12-e307-4a47-acde-68dc1550e251/4270-3
00:00:15.754 --> 00:00:19.011
let's get through the agenda. So
today we'll be discussing

d3f2ed12-e307-4a47-acde-68dc1550e251/4270-4
00:00:19.011 --> 00:00:19.508
password.

d3f2ed12-e307-4a47-acde-68dc1550e251/4340-0
00:00:20.948 --> 00:00:23.746
Problem statement ID
implementation and the

d3f2ed12-e307-4a47-acde-68dc1550e251/4340-1
00:00:23.746 --> 00:00:27.562
technology used along with the
demonstration at the end. So

d3f2ed12-e307-4a47-acde-68dc1550e251/4340-2
00:00:27.562 --> 00:00:31.504
what's the problem statement?
According to some research, 90%

d3f2ed12-e307-4a47-acde-68dc1550e251/4340-3
00:00:31.504 --> 00:00:35.510
of the passwords are vulnerable
and are easy to predict. So it

d3f2ed12-e307-4a47-acde-68dc1550e251/4340-4
00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:39.326
becomes important to prevent the
users from setting up such

d3f2ed12-e307-4a47-acde-68dc1550e251/4340-5
00:00:39.326 --> 00:00:43.523
passwords in the application and
the main cause of this bridge is

d3f2ed12-e307-4a47-acde-68dc1550e251/4340-6
00:00:43.523 --> 00:00:47.338
the use of some patterns in the
password. So we are problem

d3f2ed12-e307-4a47-acde-68dc1550e251/4340-7
00:00:47.338 --> 00:00:51.344
statement revolves around that
that is to find the patterns in

d3f2ed12-e307-4a47-acde-68dc1550e251/4340-8
00:00:51.344 --> 00:00:51.598
the.

d3f2ed12-e307-4a47-acde-68dc1550e251/4391-0
00:00:51.678 --> 00:00:55.897
Us so it's so the implementation
will be basically on the part of

d3f2ed12-e307-4a47-acde-68dc1550e251/4391-1
00:00:55.897 --> 00:00:59.860
analyzing the old password that
are there in the database for

d3f2ed12-e307-4a47-acde-68dc1550e251/4391-2
00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:03.311
the users analysis of user
information, user profile,

d3f2ed12-e307-4a47-acde-68dc1550e251/4391-3
00:01:03.311 --> 00:01:07.274
etcetera. And on top of that we
will be using some of the NLP

d3f2ed12-e307-4a47-acde-68dc1550e251/4391-4
00:01:07.274 --> 00:01:10.981
models to find the common
language words that are present

d3f2ed12-e307-4a47-acde-68dc1550e251/4391-5
00:01:10.981 --> 00:01:11.428
in the.

d3f2ed12-e307-4a47-acde-68dc1550e251/4441-0
00:01:12.648 --> 00:01:16.914
Password so the text stack we
are using. So we have uh these

d3f2ed12-e307-4a47-acde-68dc1550e251/4441-1
00:01:16.914 --> 00:01:21.179
technologies to build up the
demo application for the UI and

d3f2ed12-e307-4a47-acde-68dc1550e251/4441-2
00:01:21.179 --> 00:01:25.375
we will have a flask framework
running on top of Python And

d3f2ed12-e307-4a47-acde-68dc1550e251/4441-3
00:01:25.375 --> 00:01:29.850
we'll be using some of the NLP
libraries along with tiny DB for

d3f2ed12-e307-4a47-acde-68dc1550e251/4441-4
00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.668
storing the user database.

d3f2ed12-e307-4a47-acde-68dc1550e251/4446-0
00:01:34.688 --> 00:01:36.458
Let's take a look at the demo.

d3f2ed12-e307-4a47-acde-68dc1550e251/4521-0
00:01:37.398 --> 00:01:41.077
So before going to the demo,
I'll just walk you through the

d3f2ed12-e307-4a47-acde-68dc1550e251/4521-1
00:01:41.077 --> 00:01:44.327
code. So this is the code
repository. So to run this

d3f2ed12-e307-4a47-acde-68dc1550e251/4521-2
00:01:44.327 --> 00:01:48.190
application we will be starting
with App dot Pai, so this will

d3f2ed12-e307-4a47-acde-68dc1550e251/4521-3
00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:51.624
be the entry point for the
project and in the source we

d3f2ed12-e307-4a47-acde-68dc1550e251/4521-4
00:01:51.624 --> 00:01:55.119
have this file that will be
having the all the logic for

d3f2ed12-e307-4a47-acde-68dc1550e251/4521-5
00:01:55.119 --> 00:01:59.043
finding the patterns and there
is some file called wordlist dot

d3f2ed12-e307-4a47-acde-68dc1550e251/4521-6
00:01:59.043 --> 00:02:02.660
TXT that will prevent the user
from setting up some common

d3f2ed12-e307-4a47-acde-68dc1550e251/4521-7
00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:03.028
words.

d3f2ed12-e307-4a47-acde-68dc1550e251/4562-0
00:02:04.528 --> 00:02:09.116
In the yeah. And after that we
have just this DB dot Jason this

d3f2ed12-e307-4a47-acde-68dc1550e251/4562-1
00:02:09.116 --> 00:02:13.703
is sample database that I have
for the user particular user and

d3f2ed12-e307-4a47-acde-68dc1550e251/4562-2
00:02:13.703 --> 00:02:17.861
there are some old passwords,
security questions and some

d3f2ed12-e307-4a47-acde-68dc1550e251/4562-3
00:02:17.861 --> 00:02:22.233
personal details of the user
available. Let's take a look at

d3f2ed12-e307-4a47-acde-68dc1550e251/4562-4
00:02:22.233 --> 00:02:22.878
the demo.

d3f2ed12-e307-4a47-acde-68dc1550e251/4582-0
00:02:25.708 --> 00:02:29.882
So this is the application for a
logging to the particular

d3f2ed12-e307-4a47-acde-68dc1550e251/4582-1
00:02:29.882 --> 00:02:34.197
application, so I'll just use
the user that I have available

d3f2ed12-e307-4a47-acde-68dc1550e251/4582-2
00:02:34.197 --> 00:02:35.328
in the database.

d3f2ed12-e307-4a47-acde-68dc1550e251/4621-0
00:02:36.418 --> 00:02:39.991
So once I successfully log in,
I'll be lending to this home

d3f2ed12-e307-4a47-acde-68dc1550e251/4621-1
00:02:39.991 --> 00:02:42.968
screen where I have some
password service related

d3f2ed12-e307-4a47-acde-68dc1550e251/4621-2
00:02:42.968 --> 00:02:46.541
functionalities like change of
the password, second factor,

d3f2ed12-e307-4a47-acde-68dc1550e251/4621-3
00:02:46.541 --> 00:02:49.637
authentication, security
questions and updating the

d3f2ed12-e307-4a47-acde-68dc1550e251/4621-4
00:02:49.637 --> 00:02:50.768
profile. So if you.

d3f2ed12-e307-4a47-acde-68dc1550e251/4703-0
00:02:51.778 --> 00:02:54.986
Take a look at the profile. You
will see all the personal

d3f2ed12-e307-4a47-acde-68dc1550e251/4703-1
00:02:54.986 --> 00:02:58.525
information of the users that it
has been there in the database

d3f2ed12-e307-4a47-acde-68dc1550e251/4703-2
00:02:58.525 --> 00:03:02.008
file. So and user have a choice
to update this particular user

d3f2ed12-e307-4a47-acde-68dc1550e251/4703-3
00:03:02.008 --> 00:03:05.437
information and setting up some
of the security questions. So

d3f2ed12-e307-4a47-acde-68dc1550e251/4703-4
00:03:05.437 --> 00:03:08.699
there are set of security
questions available for the user

d3f2ed12-e307-4a47-acde-68dc1550e251/4703-5
00:03:08.699 --> 00:03:12.238
to set. I have chose these two
questions for the as part of the

d3f2ed12-e307-4a47-acde-68dc1550e251/4703-6
00:03:12.238 --> 00:03:15.501
security questions and we will
be demonstrating the change

d3f2ed12-e307-4a47-acde-68dc1550e251/4703-7
00:03:15.501 --> 00:03:18.818
password. So before that I'll I
want you to take a look at.

d3f2ed12-e307-4a47-acde-68dc1550e251/4771-0
00:03:18.898 --> 00:03:23.378
Done these two parameters, so
one is the name of my favorite

d3f2ed12-e307-4a47-acde-68dc1550e251/4771-1
00:03:23.378 --> 00:03:27.637
pet. I'll try to set up my
password around this and let's

d3f2ed12-e307-4a47-acde-68dc1550e251/4771-2
00:03:27.637 --> 00:03:32.189
say my date of birth, so I'll
try to use these two parameters

d3f2ed12-e307-4a47-acde-68dc1550e251/4771-3
00:03:32.189 --> 00:03:36.742
in the password along with some
old passwords. So if I take a

d3f2ed12-e307-4a47-acde-68dc1550e251/4771-4
00:03:36.742 --> 00:03:41.589
look at the DB dot JSON I'll see
these are some of the sample old

d3f2ed12-e307-4a47-acde-68dc1550e251/4771-5
00:03:41.589 --> 00:03:46.288
passwords that were available.
So I'll be using those passwords

d3f2ed12-e307-4a47-acde-68dc1550e251/4771-6
00:03:46.288 --> 00:03:48.858
in the new password. So let's
say.

d3f2ed12-e307-4a47-acde-68dc1550e251/4773-0
00:03:49.018 --> 00:03:49.578
Umm.

d3f2ed12-e307-4a47-acde-68dc1550e251/4830-0
00:04:03.258 --> 00:04:06.928
So from the password it might
look like a very complex

d3f2ed12-e307-4a47-acde-68dc1550e251/4830-1
00:04:06.928 --> 00:04:10.331
password and let verify it
through the our pattern

d3f2ed12-e307-4a47-acde-68dc1550e251/4830-2
00:04:10.331 --> 00:04:14.668
identification method. So when I
send click on the verify button

d3f2ed12-e307-4a47-acde-68dc1550e251/4830-3
00:04:14.668 --> 00:04:18.605
so it says there are four
warnings and my submit button is

d3f2ed12-e307-4a47-acde-68dc1550e251/4830-4
00:04:18.605 --> 00:04:22.808
disabled. So I can't change my
password until I resolve these.

d3f2ed12-e307-4a47-acde-68dc1550e251/4912-0
00:04:23.928 --> 00:04:27.407
Warnings. So it says a pattern
forms in four of the aspects

d3f2ed12-e307-4a47-acde-68dc1550e251/4912-1
00:04:27.407 --> 00:04:30.827
like security answer exist, new
password contains the user

d3f2ed12-e307-4a47-acde-68dc1550e251/4912-2
00:04:30.827 --> 00:04:34.015
information and some old
password pattern is there and

d3f2ed12-e307-4a47-acde-68dc1550e251/4912-3
00:04:34.015 --> 00:04:37.377
NLP found some common words,
some dictionary words in the

d3f2ed12-e307-4a47-acde-68dc1550e251/4912-4
00:04:37.377 --> 00:04:40.855
particular new password. So
let's try to resolve 1 by 1. So

d3f2ed12-e307-4a47-acde-68dc1550e251/4912-5
00:04:40.855 --> 00:04:44.623
as you know as you have seen my
date of birth is 28 Feb 1999. So

d3f2ed12-e307-4a47-acde-68dc1550e251/4912-6
00:04:44.623 --> 00:04:48.043
let's try to change it to some
different value that is not

d3f2ed12-e307-4a47-acde-68dc1550e251/4912-7
00:04:48.043 --> 00:04:51.522
available in the password. So
I'll try to change it to this

d3f2ed12-e307-4a47-acde-68dc1550e251/4912-8
00:04:51.522 --> 00:04:53.898
and then I'll verify the
password again.

d3f2ed12-e307-4a47-acde-68dc1550e251/4920-0
00:04:54.958 --> 00:04:56.388
So as you can see, one of the
bus.

d3f2ed12-e307-4a47-acde-68dc1550e251/4963-0
00:04:57.108 --> 00:05:00.625
Personal information warning has
been gone, so let's try to uh,

d3f2ed12-e307-4a47-acde-68dc1550e251/4963-1
00:05:00.625 --> 00:05:03.976
uh, change one more. So this
password has been repeated from

d3f2ed12-e307-4a47-acde-68dc1550e251/4963-2
00:05:03.976 --> 00:05:07.108
my old password. So this
particular string out of it. So

d3f2ed12-e307-4a47-acde-68dc1550e251/4963-3
00:05:07.108 --> 00:05:10.404
I'll just remove it and I'll
replace it with something that

d3f2ed12-e307-4a47-acde-68dc1550e251/4963-4
00:05:10.404 --> 00:05:11.118
has not been.

d3f2ed12-e307-4a47-acde-68dc1550e251/4965-0
00:05:11.198 --> 00:05:11.548
No.

d3f2ed12-e307-4a47-acde-68dc1550e251/5015-0
00:05:12.738 --> 00:05:17.151
Used before and let's try to
verify the password again. So as

d3f2ed12-e307-4a47-acde-68dc1550e251/5015-1
00:05:17.151 --> 00:05:21.422
you can see that warning has
also been gone. So there is my

d3f2ed12-e307-4a47-acde-68dc1550e251/5015-2
00:05:21.422 --> 00:05:26.048
pet name available and that that
was my security answer as well.

d3f2ed12-e307-4a47-acde-68dc1550e251/5015-3
00:05:26.048 --> 00:05:30.390
So I'll remove the sum of the
characters from that and let's

d3f2ed12-e307-4a47-acde-68dc1550e251/5015-4
00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:30.888
try to.

d3f2ed12-e307-4a47-acde-68dc1550e251/5050-0
00:05:31.828 --> 00:05:35.222
Verify the password so as you
can see that warning has also

d3f2ed12-e307-4a47-acde-68dc1550e251/5050-1
00:05:35.222 --> 00:05:38.560
gone. So it says now some
predictable or common dictionary

d3f2ed12-e307-4a47-acde-68dc1550e251/5050-2
00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:42.124
words are there. So as you can
see there is something cache is

d3f2ed12-e307-4a47-acde-68dc1550e251/5050-3
00:05:42.124 --> 00:05:43.368
there. So if I remove.

d3f2ed12-e307-4a47-acde-68dc1550e251/5073-0
00:05:46.688 --> 00:05:51.230
This. Yeah. Now, now. This looks
like something that doesn't have

d3f2ed12-e307-4a47-acde-68dc1550e251/5073-1
00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:55.358
any dictionary word. Let's find
out. And. Yeah, so now all.

d3f2ed12-e307-4a47-acde-68dc1550e251/5112-0
00:05:55.998 --> 00:05:59.932
The warnings are gone and the
submit button is enabled. So if

d3f2ed12-e307-4a47-acde-68dc1550e251/5112-1
00:05:59.932 --> 00:06:03.993
I submit the password as let me
check the database as well so I

d3f2ed12-e307-4a47-acde-68dc1550e251/5112-2
00:06:03.993 --> 00:06:07.483
can see that my database has
been updated with the new

d3f2ed12-e307-4a47-acde-68dc1550e251/5112-3
00:06:07.483 --> 00:06:11.417
password and if I try to log in
with the new password I'll be

d3f2ed12-e307-4a47-acde-68dc1550e251/5112-4
00:06:11.417 --> 00:06:12.368
able to log in.

d3f2ed12-e307-4a47-acde-68dc1550e251/5115-0
00:06:16.548 --> 00:06:17.048
Thank you.
